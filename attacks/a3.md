## Description

This attack is named as `fake EOS attack (Type II)`. Specifically, the root cause of this attack is identical to A2, i.e., due to the insufficient verification on `code` of *apply* in EOSIO smart contracts.

## Attack instance

The following code snippet shows an *apply* function that is vulnerable to fake EOS attack (Type II).

```c++
void apply(uint64_t receiver, uint64_t code, uint64_t action) {
  auto self = receiver;
  if (action == N(onerror)) {
    eosio_assert(code == N(eosio), "onerror action's are only valid from eosio");
  }
  if(code == self || code == N(eosio.token) || action == N(onerror)) {
    switch(action){
      // corresponding function
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

As we can see, in the above code snippet, *apply* verifies `code == N(eosio.token)`. However, before that, there is a `code == self`, which means it accepts direct invocation. To this end, if attackers directly invokes its *transfer* function, it will be tricked into thinking it had received a transfer.

This type of attack is well-studied in [EOSafe](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/he-ningyu), where researchers can find the relevant artifacts.
