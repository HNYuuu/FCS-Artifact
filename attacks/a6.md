## Description

This attack is named as `random number prediction attack (Type II)`. Specifically, gambling DApps in EOSIO heavily rely on random numbers to determine if an account wins a jackpot. Therefore, if the random number of the next round is predictable, attackers can win prizes nearly without costs.

## Attack instance

The following code snippet illustrate how a random number is calculated by a well-known gambling DApp, named EOSDice, after it was attacked by A5:

```c++
uint8_t random(name name, uint64_t game_id) { 
  auto eos_token = eosio::token(N(eosio.token));
  auto symbol = symbol_type(S(4, EOS)).name();
  asset pool_eos         = eos_token.get_balance(_self          , symbol);
  asset ram_eos          = eos_token.get_balance(N(eosio.ram)   , symbol);
  asset betdiceadmin_eos = eos_token.get_balance(N(betdiceadmin), symbol);
  asset newdexpocket_eos = eos_token.get_balance(N(newdexpocket), symbol);
  asset chintailease_eos = eos_token.get_balance(N(chintailease), symbol);
  asset eosbiggame44_eos = eos_token.get_balance(N(eosbiggame44), symbol);
  asset total_eos = asset(0, S(4, EOS));
  total_eos = pool_eos + ram_eos + betdiceadmin_eos + newdexpocket_eos + chintailease_eos + eosbiggame44_eos;
  
  // seeds
  auto mixd = tapos_block_prefix() * tapos_block_num() + name + game_id - current_time() + total_eos.amount;
  // generate a random number
}
```

As we can see, instead of using `pool_eos` in A5, it adopts `total_eos` which is the amount of EOS tokens held by several accounts. However, attackers repeatedly can transfer $1 \times 10^{-4}$ EOS (the minimum allowed transferring amount) to any of those accounts till the final result successfully collide with their betting. Consequently, attackers can pre-determine what the jackpot really is, and win this game.
