## Description

This attack is named as `permission-less injection attack`. Specifically, in EOSIO, actions can carry permissions. If contracts does not strictly verify the carrying permissions, attackers can perform malicious behavior on behalf of others.

## Attack instance

This attack has happened against the DEOS Game, a gambling DApp in EOSIO.Specifically, attackers invoke the transfer of thedeosgames, the official contract of DEOS Game. As the contract neither comprehensively verifies the `code` in *apply* (V2), nor checks the carrying permission with the incoming action in *transfer* (V6), attackers can construct transfer requests where the payer and payee are real token holders and attackers themselves, respectively. In other words, attackers can transfer assets out on behalf of others.

The following transaction illustrates the attack behavior:

This type of attack is well-studied in [EOSafe](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/he-ningyu), where researchers can find the relevant artifacts.
