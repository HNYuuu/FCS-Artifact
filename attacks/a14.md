## Description

This attack is named as `blacklisted rollback attack (Type I)`. In EOSIO, BPs are responsible for generating blocks in order, where they also maintain a blacklist. For transactions initiated from any users listed on the blacklist, BPs will immediately drop the them. This mechanism can be abused by attackers.

## Attack instance

We assume an attacker is already on the BP's blacklist. He can initiate a transaction through a proxy to a gambling DApp, which seperates betting and revealing into two transactions. If the bet hits the jackpot, the prize will be returned. However, the betting transaction will be reverted because the attacker is the initiator. Thus, only the prize-returning transaction initiated by the DApp is recorded on-chain.
