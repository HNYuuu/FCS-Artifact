## Description

This attack is named as `random number prediction attack (Type I)`. Specifically, gambling DApps in EOSIO heavily rely on random numbers to determine if an account wins a jackpot. Therefore, if the random number of the next round is predictable, attackers can win prizes nearly without costs.

## Attack instance

The following code snippet illustrate how a random number is calculated by a well-known gambling DApp, named EOSDice:

```c++
uint8_t random(name name, uint64_t game_id) { 
  asset pool_eos = get_balance(name);
  // seeds
  auto mixd = tapos_block_prefix() * tapos_block_num() + name + game_id - current_time() + pool_eos.amount;
  // generate a random number
}
```

As we can see, all seeds used to calculate `mixd` is detemined. Therefore, attackers can pre-determine what the jackpot really is, and win this game in each round.
