## Description

This attack is named as `integer overflow attack`. The root cause of this attack is that EOSIO takes undefined behaviors in C++ as an always true in Wasm bytecode. Therefore, the exploitation can bypass the assertion and perform integer overflow.

## Attack instance

The following transaction illustrates the attack behavior:
- [tx1](https://www.bloks.io/transaction/09f3fa6668eb4bc3431a7f6df731a9d80856a1f773564489130b7ae043438ab7?tab=traces)
