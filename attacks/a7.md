## Description

This attack is named as `random number prediction attack (Type III)`. Specifically, this one is slightly different with the above one. Attackers manipulate the random number by controlling the transactions in blocks.

## Attack instance

In A4 and A5, victims use the predictable variables as seeds to calculate the jackpot. However, gambling DApps can indeed use the un-predictable ones.

To this end, attackers can initiate a huge number of transactions. When these transactions flood into EOSIO network, the decrease of available time in BP results in an abnormally high CPU price. The deviated resource price hampers the desire and increases the difficulty of initiating transactions. The block's body is fully occupied by attackers' transactions. Therefore, the metadata of a future block can be predicted to some extent.
