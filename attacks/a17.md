## Description

This attack is named as `resource competition based DoS attack`. Though EOSIO adopts a resource system, which allows users to initiate transaction nearly without costs, it only happens under normal situations. Under extreme situations, users will have no resources to initiate transactions.

## Attack instance

This typs of attack is initiated by EIDOS, a project built on EOSIO. It allows users to transfer EOS tokens to it and returns tokens immediately. Alongside the token return, it will also give users some EIDOS tokens. Because such tokens can be traded on exchanges, users flood into such a meaningless movement. The whole network is nearly paralyzed.
