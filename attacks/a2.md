## Description

This attack is named as `fake EOS attack (Type I)`. Specifically, the root cause of this attack is due to the insufficient verification on `code` of *apply* in EOSIO smart contracts.

## Attack instance

The following code snippet shows an *apply* function that is vulnerable to fake EOS attack (Type I).

```c++
void apply(uint64_t receiver, uint64_t code, uint64_t action) {
  auto self = receiver;
  switch(action){
      // corresponding function
  }
}
```

As we can see, in the above code snippet, *apply* does not verify the `code` at all. Thus, if it is notified by the *transfer* function from another account, instead of *eosio.token*. The smart contract is tricked into thinking it had received a transfer.

This type of attack is well-studied in [EOSafe](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/he-ningyu), where researchers can find the relevant artifacts.
