## Description

This attack is named as `blacklisted rollback attack (Type II)`. In EOSIO, BPs are responsible for generating blocks in order, where they also maintain a blacklist. For transactions initiated from any users listed on the blacklist, BPs will immediately drop the them. This mechanism can be abused by attackers.

## Attack instance

In A14, the betting transaction is reverted, while the revealing one is kept on-chain. Therefore, DApp started to let the latter one verify the existence of the former one. However, it can still be exploited. Under this attack, if the proxy is notified it has hit the jackpot, it will immediately replay the betting transaction by itself. Because the proxy is not listed on the blacklist, its betting transaction will not be dropped by BPs. To this end, if the gambling DApp does not change the seeds to generate the jackpot, the proxy can also win this round.
