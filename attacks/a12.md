## Description

This attack is named as `fake deposit attack`. Specifically, this type of attack happens on other blockchain platforms, and has been studied by lots of work. It is basically due to the missing check on transactions' status field.

## Attack instance

In EOSIO, except for the successfully executed transactions, `hard_fail` ones are recorded on-chain also. To be specific, `hard_fail` transactions correspond to the failed deferred transactions, as they actually take the storage space of BPs before being executed. Additionally, such a status indicates both the transaction and the error handler are objectively failed, where the error handler is often implemented in *apply*.

```c++
[[eosio::action]]
void token::transfer( /* args */ ) {
  // initialization and authority check
  ...
  // notify payer and payee
  require_recipient(from);
  require_recipient(to);
  // check token's validity
  ...
  // check balance and update balance table
  sub_balance(from, quantity);
  add_balance(to, quantity, payer);
}
```

The above example shows how transfer is implemented by the EOSIO official. We can observe that if the balance is insufficient, only after the notifications to both payer and payee, such a transfer will throw an exception. The exception, however, cannot be caught by attackersâ€™ client node, as there is no smart contract, resulting in a transaction with the `hard_fail` status.

The following transaction illustrates the attack behavior:
