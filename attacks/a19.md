## Description

This attack is named as `CPU hijack attack`. It is similar to A18, i.e., EOSIO allows someone to pay for CPU resources used by other accounts.

## Attack instance

On November 6th, 2019, due to the shortage of CPU resources, the gambling DApp BigGame announced that it would pay the CPU on behalf of players to attract them.
Thus, malicious players pretend to play the game and embed inlined actions to transfer EOS tokens to the EIDOS project (refer to [A17](./a17.md)).

The following transaction illustrates the attack behavior:
