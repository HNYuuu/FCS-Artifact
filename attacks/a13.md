## Description

This attack is named as `malicious rollback attack`. In EOSIO, a transaction is composed of actions, where any of them is reverted the whole transaction will be reverted immediately. Therefore, if transactions of gambling DApps can be reverted, it will be an unfair game.

## Attack instance

If gambling DApps adopt synchronous revealing strategy, i.e., betting and revealing are located in an identical transaction, attackers can exploit the game. Specifically, after the revealing, they are able to initiate an inlined action to the DApp or the token's issuer to query if they won the prize. According to the results, like balance change, they can choose either continue the game or intentionally revert it by a failed assertion. Eventually, attackers look like a super lucky guy who win prizes in each round.
