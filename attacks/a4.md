## Description

This attack is named as `fake receipt attack`. Specifically, even the *apply* function examines `code` comprehensively, it can still be fooled as notifications can be relayed arbitrarily. Therefore, if a contract does not examine the actual beneficiary of a transfer notification, it will be misled by such a seemingly valid notification.

## Attack instance

The following code snippets illustrate how a vulnerable *transfer* function looks like:

```c++
void transfer(uint64_t sender, uint64_t receiver) {
  auto data = unpack_action_data<st_transfer>();
  if (data.from == _self || data.from == N(eosbetcasino)) {
    return;
  }
  ...
}
```

As we can see, the *transfer* function only checks the `from` field, instead of the `to` field. Thus, it can be deceived as it is the beneficiary of a token transfer.

This type of attack is well-studied in [EOSafe](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/he-ningyu), where researchers can find the relevant artifacts.
