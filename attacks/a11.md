## Description

This attack is named as `eosio.code permission misuse attack`. Specifically, EOSIO smart contracts are updatable. Therefore, EOSIO has designed a specific permission, named `eosio.code`. If an account actively links someone’s `eosio.code` permission to his `active` or even `owner` permission, it means he totally believes in another’s contract, even it can be updated.

## Attack instance

This type of attack has happend on eosfo.io. Specifically, it deceived its players to link its `eosio.code` permission to the players' `owner` and `active` permissions for a better gaming experience. However, if the DApp maliciously updates its *transfer* function, it can transfer remained EOS to a designated account on behalf of the participated players.

This type of attack is well-studied in [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392155), where researchers can find the relevant artifacts.
