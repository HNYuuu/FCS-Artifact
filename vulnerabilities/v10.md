## Description

This vulnerability is named as `exploitation on blacklist`. Specifically, there are 21 *block producers* (BPs) on EOSIO, responsible for generating new blocks in order. Each of them maintains a blacklist, which ensures that if a transaction's initiator is listed on the blacklist the whole transaction will be reverted. However, attackers can abuse this feature, deliberately revert the designated transactions while keeping the other ones.
