## Description

This vulnerability is named as `top-priority deferred transaction`. Specifically, EOSIO allows the existence of *deferred transactions*, which will be executed if and only if the set delayed time reaches. To guarantee the deferred tranactions will be executed on time, they have the top-priority among all transaction. Therefore, if attackers abuse this feature and embed dead loops in them, the network will be paralyzed.
