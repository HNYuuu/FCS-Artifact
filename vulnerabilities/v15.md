## Description

This vulnerability is named as `private key compromising`. Specifically, each account is associated with a pair of private and public keys. Therefore, after compromising the private key, attackers could perform arbitrary actions, e.g., transferring tokens and initiating transactions, on behalf of the victim without authorization. This will result in discredit or financial loss for victims.
