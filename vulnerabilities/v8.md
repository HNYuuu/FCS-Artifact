## Description

This vulnerability is named as `uncheck status`, which is similar to the *fake deposit* vulnerability in other blockchain platforms. Specifically, service providers only offer services to the payer, who sent transactions with tokens to the service provider. If the transaction fails, in other words, reverted, it will not appear on-chain. However, there is a type of tranasction that will stay on-chain even it fails. Therefore, if the service provider does not check the status of transactions carefully, it will be fooled by such failed transactions.
