## Description

This vulnerability is named as `deficient resource system`. Specifically, under normal situations, users can initiate transactions nearly without costs as they can mortgage EOS tokens to resources. However, under extreme situations, the price for mortgaging resources will be fluctuated dramatically according to the relations between demand and supply, which can lead to denial-of-service attacks on EOSIO.
