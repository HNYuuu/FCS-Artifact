## Description

This vulnerability is named as `arbitrary rollback`. Specifically, analogous to the internal transactions in Ethereum, the action plays the same role in EOSIO. In other words, if an action fails, the whole transaction it belongs to will be reverted completely. Therefore, if a gamlbing DApp adopts the *synchronous revealing* strategy, i.e., placing the betting and revealing within a single transaction, attackers can revert the whole transaction if they find themselves are not the winner.
