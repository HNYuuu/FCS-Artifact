## Description

This vulnerability is named as `inadequate permission verification`. Specifically, there is an authority system in EOSIO. Each account has a set of hierarchical permissions, like `owner` and `active`, while each action can carry any of them from the initiator. Therefore, if a function does not carefully check the carrying permission, some sensitive operations may be conducted unexpectedly.
