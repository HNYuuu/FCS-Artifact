## Description

This vulnerability is named as `freely invoked inlined action`. Specifically, because EOSIO smart contracts are updatable, if an updated contract performs malicious behaviors, it may cause financial losses for its users. For example, after being invoked by an action from users, it can initiate another inlined action, where the permission automatically inherits from the original users. Therefore, such a malicious DApp can operate on behalf of its users.
