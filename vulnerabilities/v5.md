## Description

This vulnerability is named as `re-entrancy`. Specifically, re-entrancy is a well-studied topic in lots of other blockchain platforms. The critical reason is that the state is updated *after* the external call. In this way, if attackers find a way to re-enter the function, because the state is not updated timely, the external call can be invoked recursively.
