## Description

This vulnerability is named as `abnormal parser`. Specifically, there is a memo field in transactions, which is typically used to carry additional information, such as the dice number when player places a bet. Some back-end servers of gambling DApps utilize this mechanism to parse the player's betting options. However, if the processing logic of memo parser is vulnerable, it would be attacked by carefully constructed content, e.g., the SQL injection.
