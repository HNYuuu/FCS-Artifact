## Description

This vulnerability is named as `asset overflow`.

Specifically, EOSIO adopts a user-defined struct, named *asset*, to encapsulate a certain amount of tokens. The multiplication operator on *asset* is overloaded, as shown below:

```C++
asset& operator*=(int64_t a) {
  // multiplication overflow
  eosio_assert(a==0 || (amount*a)/a==amount);
  // multiplication underflow
  eosio_assert(-max_amount<=amount);
  // multiplication overflow
  eosio_assert(amount<=max_amount);
  amount *= a;
  return *this;
}
```

The first assertion ensures that there will not be integer overflow or underflow. However, after being compiled to Wasm bytecode, the assertion behaves as below:

```
(call $eosio_assert
  (i32.const 1)    // always true
  (i32.const 224)  // pointer
)
```

The assertion condition is always *True*. Therefore, the assertion is invalidated.
