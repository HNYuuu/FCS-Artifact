## Description

This vulnerability is named as `assignable resource payer`. Specifically, in EOSIO, executing a transaction costs CPU and storing permanent data requires RAM. However, both of them can be charged from other accounts instead of the transaction initiators. To this end, if someone unexpectedly pay for other accounts, he will suffer financial losses.
