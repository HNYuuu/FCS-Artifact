## Description

This vulnerability is named as `insufficient code verification`. It appears at the *apply* function in EOSIO smart contracts.

## Code snippet

Here is an *apply* function example:
```c++
void apply(uint64_t receiver, uint64_t code, uint64_t action){
  if(code == _self || code == N(eosio.token)){
    switch(action){
      // corresponding function
    }
  }
}
```

When dealing with direct invocations and received notifications, the meaning of the argument `code` in *apply* is subtly different. If the verification does not check the `code` comprehensively, unexpected behaviors shall happen.
